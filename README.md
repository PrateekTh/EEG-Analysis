# Analysis of Canine EEGs for Mental State Classification

This project tries to analyse a Canine Olfactory EEG Dataset containing three classes:

* Green Tea
* Black (Chamomile) Tea
* None
  
There are various steps involved in the process, and the workflow here may be divided into three major sections:
* Setup - Involves setting up dependencies, and loading data.
* Data Preprocessing - Processing Data and Epochs.
* Machine Learning - Applying different ML Algorithms.
